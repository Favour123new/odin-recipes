    </div>
        <p class="paragraphDesc">Nigerian Fried Rice is a 
            very simple yet delicious recipe. This version 
            relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, 
            and a little bit of oil for crisping it up.
            The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very 
            nice rich but subtle taste, and this is why it is 
            one of the most popular choices in Nigeria. Though 
            you can also use Shrimp or any protein you’d like.  
            If you would love to make vegan fried rice, you can
             omit the Beef liver or Shrimps entirely!
             This fried rice is entirely different from the 
             popular Asian Chicken Fried Rice because the depth 
             of the taste in the latter comes from the Soy sauce
              while the depth of taste of the latter comes from 
              the Curry powder, Thyme, Seasoning cubes, and of 
              course the abundance of vegetables like Carrots,
               Green beans, Peas, sweet corn, and Onions.

<h3 class="ingredients">INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul class="doughIng">
            <li>3¾ cups (750g) 
                long grain parboiled rice</li> 
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Chicken (whole chicken or chicken drumsticks)</li> 
            <li>100g cow liver</li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon Nigerian curry powder (NOT Indian Curry)</li>
            <li>½ cup green beans</li>
            <li>3 carrots</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>3 onions</li>
            <li>3 stock/boullion cubes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="meatDough">CUT THE VEGETABLES</p>
        <ol class="stepOl">
            <li>Wash all the vegetables to be used
                 in cooking the fried rice. Scrape 
                 and cut the carrots into tiny cubes. 
                 Cut the green beans into small pieces of 
                 about 0.7cm long. Soak these 2 vegetables 
                 separately in hot water for about 5 minutes 
                 and drain. Cut 1 bulb of onion. Set all these aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="meatDough">PREPARE THE COW AND LIVER</p>
        <ol class="stepOl">
            <li>Cook the cow liver till done and cut into tiny
                 pieces. To save time and energy, you can cook 
                 the liver with the chicken as I did in the video below.</li>
                 <li>Cut the whole chicken into pieces and cook with the 
                    Knorr cubes, thyme and 2 bulbs of onions (chopped). 
                    When done, grill in an oven or deepfry with vegetable oil.
                     This gives it a golden look which is more presentable especially
                      when you are entertaining guests. Read how to season and grill chicken
                       for more details.</li>
            <p class="meatDough">COOKING DIRECTIONS</p>
             <ol class="stepOl">
                <li>Parboil the rice using the method 
                    detailed in parboiling rice for 
                    cooking fried rice. A well parboiled 
                    rice ensures that the grains of the 
                    rice will not stick together when 
                    the rice is done. Rinse the parboiled 
                    rice with cold water and put in a sieve 
                    so all the water drains out.</li>
                    <li>Pour the chicken stock into a 
                        sieve to remove all traces of
                         onions, thyme etc used in 
                         cooking the chicken. Pour 
                         the stock into a pot and 
                         set to boil. Once the water
                          boils, add the parboiled 
                          rice. Also, add 1 tablespoon
                           of plain yellow curry powder,
                            then add salt to taste. The 
                            plain yellow curry powder is
                             merely for colouring so should
                              not contain chilli.</li>
                              <li>The water level 
                                should be slightly 
                                less than the level of the rice;
                                 at most it should be at the 
                                 same level as the rice. This
                                  is to ensure that all the 
                                  water dries up by the time
                                   the rice is cooked and that
                                    the rice is not over cooked.
                                     This is the quantity of 
                                     water that will cook the
                                      rice and the grains will
                                       not stick together. Stir 
                                       the contents; cover the
                                        pot and leave to cook 
                                        on medium heat. This way
                                         the rice does not burn 
                                         before the water dries up.</li>
                                         <li>Once the water has dried up,
                                             the rice should be cooked 
                                             perfectly. Perfect fried
                                              rice is one that the grains 
                                              are separated from one another,
                                               resistant to the bite but not 
                                               hard.</li>
                                               <li>Now, transfer the rice 
                                                to a casserole dish or another 
                                                pot to help cool it down quickly.
                                                 Again, this is essential to keep
                                                  the grains from sticking to 
                                                  each other. If left in the 
                                                  original hot pot, the rice 
                                                  will continue to cook and 
                                                  eventually stick together. 
                                                  At this point, it is advisable 
                                                  to divide the vegetables into 
                                                  say 4, 5 or even 6 equal parts.
                                                   The rice will be fried in 
                                                   batches so this number 
                                                   depends on the quantity of 
                                                   rice you can comfortably fry 
                                                   in the pan or pot. Also, 
                                                   divide the cooked rice and the
                                                    diced cow liver into the same
                                                     number of equal parts.</li>
                                                     <li>Now pour a small amount 
                                                        of vegetable oil into a 
                                                        frying pan. This quantity 
                                                        of oil should be such that 
                                                        it would be absorbed by 1 part
                                                         of the cooked rice and 1 part
                                                          each of the vegetables. 
                                                          When the oil is hot, add 
                                                          1 part of diced onions and 
                                                          stir for 10 seconds, followed
                                                           by 1 part of diced cow liver,
                                                            one part each of the diced 
                                                            vegetables, then 1 part of 
                                                            cooked rice.</li>
                                                            <li>Add more salt if necessary.
                                                                 More curry powder may also be
                                                                  added at this stage if you need
                                                                   to touch up on the colour. 
                                                                   Stir till all the ingredients 
                                                                   have mixed well and transfer 
                                                                   to a dry pot. Repeat this for 
                                                                   the remaining batches of the 
                                                                   ingredients.</li>
                                                                   <p class="meatDough">VERY IMPORTANT!</p>

                                                                    it to cool it then refrigerate immediately.
