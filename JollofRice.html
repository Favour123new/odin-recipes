    <h3 class="description">DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p class="paragraphDesc">Jollof or jollof 
        rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. 
        The dish is typically made with long-grain
         rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables
          and meat in a single pot, although its 
          ingredients and preparation methods
           vary across different regions.</p>
    <h3 class="ingredients">INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul class="doughIng">
        <li>The main ingredient 
            in jollof rice is, of 
            course, rice. I used 
            long-grain parboiled 
            rice for this recipe, 
            but you can also use basmati. 
            I have a recipe for that here
             (basmati Jollof with beef).</li> 
        <li>Next up are the canned tomato, 
            fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, 
            scotch bonnet, onions, garlic, 
            and ginger—each of which adds a 
            unique flavor and texture to your dish!</li>
        <li>You’ll also need oil for frying 
            your sauce—any kind of vegetable 
            oil will do.</li> 
        <li>Stock—Chicken, beef, or vegetable 
            stock are great choices here for 
            adding depth of flavor.</li> 
        <li>And lastly, there’s the seasoning
             and herbs—curry powder, salt,
              black/white pepper, bouillon powder,
               thyme, and bay leaves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="meatDough">COOKING DIRECTIONS</p>
             <ol class="stepOl">
                <li>The inevitable foundation 
                    for building up the flavor 
                    in this meal is to start by
                     sauteeing the Onions. This
                      should take about 3 to 5
                       minutes. The next thing
                        is to stir in the tomato
                         paste. This adds a deep
                          and rich tomato flavor
                          ; I simply fry this 
                          for another 5 minutes
                                or thereabout.</li>
                    <li>Add the ginger and garlic
                        and cook along with the tomato
                         paste for another two minutes;
                          Actually, by the time this is 
                          ready, you will notice it in the
                           smell. If you keep it cooking any
                            longer, you might risk burning them.</li>
                              <li>Add the blended peppers. Usually, 
                                there is no particular time frame 
                                for frying this pepper. I often 
                                stop when the sauce becomes really 
                                thick, and the oil literally floats
                                 on top of the sauce. At this point,
                                  most of the water is gone, and the 
                                  sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me,
                                   you will know, but just in case you 
                                   are still in doubt, I would say maybe
                                    15 to 20 minutes depending on the 
                                    quantity of water in your blended 
                                    pepper.</li>
                                         <li>Finally, in building my 
                                            flavor, I add the thyme, curry
                                             powder, salt, white pepper 
                                             (good but optional), and seasoning
                                              cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this
                                               point if there is a need to.</li>
                                               <li>Once the flavor is on point, then,
                                                 I stir in the Rice. Make sure you stir
                                                  the rice properly until you cover each
                                                   grain of rice with the sauce.</li>
                                                     <li>Now add the chicken stock. Give 
                                                        it a brief stir and cover it up 
                                                        with a tight-fitting lid. If your
                                                         lid is not fitting enough, simply
                                                          cover the rice with foil paper 
                                                          before covering it with the lid.
                                                           This is because Jollof needs a 
                                                           lot of steam in order to turn out
                                                            well.</li>
                                                            <li>Once the rice comes to a boil,
                                                                 reduce the heat to medium-low
                                                                  immediately and continue to 
                                                                  cook until the rice is done, 
                                                                  about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                                                            <li>Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.
