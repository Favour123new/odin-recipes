    </div>
        <p class="paragraphDesc">West African Meat pie or the Nigerian meat 
            pie is light and slightly Flaky and it’s 
            stuffed with well seasoned Ground Beef (minced Beef),
             potatoes, and carrots.
            These Meat pies are a comfort to the soul 
            and a delight to the palate. They can be eaten as 
            breakfast, brunch, or as a snack.
            It’s not much of a surprise that the West African 
            meat pie has a lot in common with the British pasty 
            because that is where it originates from. Though over 
            the years we (Nigerians) have found a way of making our 
            own Pies to our taste.

    <h3 class="steps">STEPS</h3>
    <ol class="stepOl">
        <p class="meatDough">MEAT PIE FILLING</p>
        <li>Peel the Irish potatoes
             and scrape the carrots, 
             wash and cut these two 
             into tiny cubes.</li>
             <li>Wash and slice the 
                onions into tiny pieces.</li>
                <li>With your cooker or 
                    stove set to medium 
                    heat, heat the vegetable 
                    oil in a pot, add the 
                    diced onions and stir 
                    for a bit, add the 
                    minced meat and stir 
                    vigorously till the minced 
                    meat turns pale.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 cup of water, 
                        Knorr cubes and thyme. 
                        Cover the pot and once 
                        the contents of the pot 
                        starts boiling, add the 
                        diced carrots and potatoes 
                        and cook till everything 
                        is well done.</li>
                        <li>Dissolve 2 tablespoons 
                            of plain flour in half 
                            cup of cold water and 
                            add to the meat pie 
                            filling. This tip is so 
                            that the meat pie filling 
                            does not dry up during baking. 
                            It is also what keeps the 
                            meat pie filling moist.</li>
                            <li>Add salt to taste, 
                                stir the contents and 
                                turn off the heat. Set 
                                the meat pie filling 
                                aside. Now is the time 
                                to prepare the dough f
                                or the meat pie.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="meatDough">MEAT PIE DOUGH</p>
    <ol class="stepOl">
        <li>Put the 1 kg of flour in a sizeable bowl;
             add 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 2 
             pinches of salt. You really do not need 
             a lot of salt for the meat pie dough. 
             The meat pie will get most of its taste 
             from the filling. Mix these dry ingredients 
             very well.</li>
             <li>Use a tablespoon to scoop the margarine 
                in small bits into the bowl of flour. The 
                smaller you make the bits of margarine, 
                the easier it will be for you to rub them 
                into the flour.</li>
                <li>Use finger tips to rub the margarine into
                     the flour till the mix becomes like crumbs.
                    Note: In Nigeria, we also refer to margarine 
                    as butter but for my audience in the Western 
                    countries, please do NOT use butter for the meatpie 
                    dough because butter is too hard and this makes it 
                    difficult for you to mix it with the flour to achieve 
                    the crumbly look. So please use margarine.
                    
                    Also butter is quite heavy so it makes the dough 
                    very greasy which hinders the elasticity of the dough.
                    
                    Can I use melted butter? No, because it simply ruins the meat pie.</li>
                    <li>Now, start adding cold water in bits while at the same
                         time folding the mix till a stiff ball of dough is 
                         formed. You will be surprised at how small quantity 
                         of water you need to get the dough stiff. At most, 
                         all you need for the 1 kg of flour is half a cup of 
                         water.</li>
                         <li>Knead the dough very well, 
                            put back in the bowl and leave to 
                            rest for 5 to 7 minutes. This makes 
                            the dough more elastic.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="meatDough">CUT,FILL,FOLD AND CLOSE</p>
    <ol class="stepOl">
        <li>Set your oven to 170°C (335°F) 
            and leave to preheat while you 
            continue with the meat pie.</li>
            <li>Rub margarine on the insides 
                of the oven tray and set aside. 
                This is so that the undersides of 
                the meat pies do not burn or stick 
                to the tray during baking.</li>
                <li>Break the egg, beat it and set aside, 
                    you will need it pretty soon.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough some more, 
                        roll it out to achieve a 5mm thickness.</li>
                        <li>Use a cutter, be it the cover of a small pot 
                            or a meat pie cutter, to make round cuts on 
                            the rolled out dough.</li>
                            <li>Remove the excess dough, leaving behind the round cuts.</li>
                            <li>Scoop some meat pie filling into the center of the round cuts,
                                 the quantity should be such that you can comfortably close the 
                                 dough without overflows. Don't worry if you over-filled the first
                                  one, you have many meat pies to fill today so at some point you 
                                  will know just the right quantity of meat pie filling to scoop into the dough.</li>
                                  <li>Rub the egg on the inside edge of the cut meatpie dough. Watch the video to see
                                     how this is done. This is to ensure that your meat pie is perfectly sealed and does 
                                     not open up while it is being baked.</li>
                                     <li>Fold one part of the dough to meet the other end and use a fork to press the 2 edges
                                         together to close tightly. Place your work of art in the oven tray and repeat the 
                                         previous step till all the cut out dough is exhausted</li>
                                         <li>Roll out more dough, cut, fill, close and place in the 
                                            greased oven tray till all the dough is used.</li>
                                            <li>Rub the egg on the meat pies. This gives 
                                                the meat pie a golden brown look when done.</li>
                                                <li>Set the tray in the preheated oven and bake 
                                                    for 30 to 40 minutes. This time will depend 
                                                    on the type and heating capacity of your oven.
                                                     For some ovens, the meat pie will be done in 
                                                     half an hour, for some, it may take up to 50 
                                                     mins. Whatever type of oven you have, the important 
                                                     thing to know is that the best meat pies are the ones
                                                      baked at medium heat. You can confirm that the meat pie
                                                       is done when it starts browning. It is alright to open 
                                                       the oven to check this.</li>
